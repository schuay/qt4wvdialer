Requirements:
-------------
- Qt library >= 3.0 <http://www.trolltech.com>
- wvdial and wvdialconf <http://www.worldvisions.ca/wvdial>

Compilation:
------------
Make shure QTDIR is set correctly and you have a development version of Qt installed. 

- untar the tarball you've downloaded
- enter the qtwvdialer directory
- type ./configure
- type make 

That's it. You should have the executable qtwvdialer now.

To run QtWvDialer as normal user you could 'chmod +s /usr/loca/bin/wvdial' and 
'chmod +xs /usr/sbin/pppd' (Your path may differ. A 'which pppd' and 'which wvdial'
as root should show you the path used on your system)

If you encounter any problems don't hesitate to contact me <qtwvdialer@mtoussaint.de>

The build process has been tested until now only with Linux and Qt-3.3.2. It would be
nice to hear if QtWvDialer compiles and works with different system configurations.
