QtWvDialer is a  simple graphical front-end  to wvdial and it's  free 
software. You need the Qt library version 3.0.0 or better and wvdial. 
It provides you with  a easy to use GUI  to fire up a ppp connection. 
Additionally  you  have  access  to the  output of  wvdial,  some PPP 
statistics  a monthly  log of  your connections  and a editor for the 
wvdial  configuration. The  code  for PPP  statistics  retrieval  was 
extracted from the very fine program kpppload from Sean Vyain. Thanks 
Sean, for this nice piece of GPL'ed code!

QtWvDialer is kind of "works for me" software. I'm using it, I like it 
the way it is and it seems  to be quite stable. But I'm shure it still 
contains tons of bugs and outside my box it will crash every second or 
two. Try it and we will learn more ...
